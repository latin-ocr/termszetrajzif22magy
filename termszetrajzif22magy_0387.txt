Fui-:THER CONTfflssUTioN To THE HUNGARIAN onNis 353

Although whole libraries have been written about the Ornis of the
western countries of Europe, we do not possess one reliable work upon the
Hungarian Avifauna. In order to fill up this gap Ι began to write a larger
ornithological work some twenty years ago, but soon saw that as long as
we had no proper notion of the Hungarian 011118, which forms a link bet-
ween the Eastern and the Mediterranean Fauna, my undertaking would
be an utterly baren one, and that it is absolutely necessary first to make
independent resurches and investigations in that direction. But nOW‚ two
decade's laborious collecting of dates and thousands of specimens of birds
originating from different parts of the country, which constitute a real trea-
sure -— deposited in the Hungarian National Museum — affordd us a pretty
true image of the Hungarian Avifauna. This collection, is in its way une-
qualled and so indispensaffle, that anyone, who undertook to write of the
Hungarian Ornis without relying on it, would miss his aim.

In 1881 Ipublished a nomenclature of Hungarian birds under the
title «Systematische Aufzahlung der Vogel Ungarn's». It compresed 345
species3 but as a large proportion of these were taken from literature,
where they obtained a place trough wrong determination, these must be
eliminated. Such are: Semnus unicolor, Buz‘lgstes (11100103, Tardus rufi-
001118, Turdus atriyulmis, Accentor montanellus, Fit-edula bonellii, Calan-
drellcc braclzyalactgs[a⁷ Melcmocoryplza calandra, Plectroplz 01108 lapponicus,
Emberiza leucocephala, Elam& melanoptmms, (1110110810 yregyarz'cz, Trin-
9oides 0100010108, Prot-ellarii( pslmista, Larus· nutrimus, Xema sabini,
Poqophila 0111111100, Sulci bassam( etc.

We may consider JOH. v. FRIVALDszKY's «Aves [101190γί0θυῖ upon our
Ornis, published by him on occasion of the II-¹¹d Ornith. Congress held at
Budapest as the most reliable work. This publication was based partly upon
the birds exhibited at the time of the Congress by the Museum and by private
persons and partly upon thos notes, which the late Ornithologist SALAMON
ΡΕΤΕΝΥΙ left us It is to be regretted‚ that the Author of this work
was not a professional Ornithologist‚ and thus was not able to under-
stand those minute differenoes, which are so highly characteristic of

our Ornis.
The object of the present paper is to enumerate whith some accom-

* It must be rememborod that halimo-ns luwsilalus onninerated on pago

it turned 001, that the bird was lnounted l'roni a skin and therefore not killed in
Dolinlm (Hungary), but in all probabelity caino through a foreign ‹lcaler into
the hand of its first proprietor; secondly 1110 species in not Fulmurus haesitatum
at all, but according to 1110 determination of iny friend Mr. n. B. SHARPE an
