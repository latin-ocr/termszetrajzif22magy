panying notes those species and subspecieS, which were omitted in FRIVALD-
szssr's «Aves Hungjcw’icw».

1. Lycus collaris (DRUMM.).

Just as the Carrion—Crow is a dimorphic form of the Hooded Crow,
Lycus· collaris· is a eastern form of the Common Jackdow. This latter has
also its well-defined geographica] range. As regards coloration L. collaris
differs not only, in having a creamy white half-collar, but the grey colour
of the occiput and the neck — especially in the breeding season — is so
much suffused with silvery white, that those parts appear nearly quite
white. Further the grey colour of the back and abdomen is lighter and still
lighter margened with grey. We may suppose that BREHM («Vogelfang»)
had such a typical L. collaris before him, when he wrote the following:
«Monedula daurica. Der Nacken und Hinterhals ist weisslich, das ganze
Gefieder hat helle Kanten. In Daurien, selten in Ungarn». Therefore Lycus
[lutericus (1160. PALL.)B12„EHM, must be considered as a synonim of L. collaris,

The typical J ackdow is found in Central- and Western-Hungary,
whilst the eastern-form : L. collaris occurs in the eastern parts of Hungary,
especially in Transylvania. On an excursion, which Ι made this year, I also
met this form in Southern Hungary on 1116 Lower-Danube.

Everywhere in Hungary, where the Eastern Jackdow is found, the
Common Jackdow also occurs, but less numerously. These two forms inter·
breed and 60 11 16 6 11161161 of course that intermediat forms arto 116 found.
The same thing occurs between the Carrion-Crow and Hooded Crow,
where their ranges come into contact.

2. Sturnus vulgaris LINN.‚ and Allies.

According 10 1116 661166 111 possession of the Hung. Nat. Museum the
typical form of scm-»ms vulqaris occurs in Northern-, Genti-al„ Western-
Hungary and Dravafok‚ whilst in the Eastern portion and Transylvania we
meet the intermediate form between St. *crealyaris and St. mcnzbieffl, which
has a purplish head and neck, and shows a little green only on the ear-
coverts. There are specimens from Transylvania, which are hardly distin·
guishable from some szww‘us mmzbe'era', originating from Luclmow.

Ι collected this year a small series of Starlings in the south of Hun-
gary near Futtak, with the head ancl neck quite glossy green and only the
occiput and throat showing a litte purplish. These must be considered as
an intermediate form between St. culparis and Sc. eamecszcus.
