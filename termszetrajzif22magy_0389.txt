FURTHER CONTRIBUTION TO THE HUNGARIAN ORNIS.

3. Emberiza cirlus LINN.

In FRIVALDSZKY'S «Aves Hunqariue» this species to geven as a doubt-
ful one‚ and occurs only in the appendix, though it replaces, on the Croato-
Hungarian Littoral the Yellow Ammer‚ wich is rather rare in those parts.

Last year Ι collected several specimens near Novi. («Termeszetrajzi Fii-
zetek», XXI. p. 470. 1898.)

4. Emberiza melanocephala Scor).

Like the former very frequent on the Littoral. The Museum of Zagrab
has one specimen from Fiume and 22 from other parts of the Croato-
Hungarian Littoral. Fmvimszm* also mentions it as doubtful in the
Appendix.

5. Galerita senegalensis (P. L. S. Mena).

This well-defined Mediterranean form inhabits the southern slope of
the· Karst mountains from Fiume along the coast and replaoes G. cristata.

Last year Ι shot 5 specimens near Novi and Povile, the Measurements
of which are as follows:

> Bill : Wing: Tail :
a) c? Novi 13-th May 17 mm. 110 mm. 73 mm.
b) 0⁷¹ « lli-th « 17 « 106 « 70 (ι

Galcrita scnessalensis differs conspicuously from the typica] G. eris-
tata inhabiting other parts of Hungary inasmuch as it is rather lighter;
above rufous brown instead of sandy brown, below tinged with light rufous
This form must be considered as a new one for the Hungarian Ornis.

6. Budytes beema (snm.

This eastern form of Ji'mlyces slavus, is represented in our Collection
by one typica] specimen, killed by the late SALAMON mmm-1 for tho collec-
tion of MIOHAEL FbLDvARY at Peteri near Budapest in May 1828. This
specimen was transferred to the Hungarian National Museum, after Fons)-
vARY’s death, and until recently figured as R. llrt'cszcs. New for the Hun-
garian Fauna.
