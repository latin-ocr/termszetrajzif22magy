7. Budytes borealis (SUND.).

I met with this species for the first time last year at Novi, when Ι
killed one pair, now in the Museum. This year we got an other male spe-
cimen from Csalokoz-Somorj‘a. G. ALMAsv (Ornith. Jahrb. IX. p. 91. 1898)
mentions four Hungarian specimens from Temes-Kubin, Velencze and
Csalokoz-Somorja.

Ohs. It must be mentioned, that we have no Budjstcns· cincrcocapillus
fron] Hungary in the Museum. I do not believe, that those spechnens, which
ALMASY (loc. cit. p. 93.) referred to and which were collected in Temes-Kubin
and Csalokoz-Soinorja‚ are B. cinerwcapzsslle1s. Those spec-iniens which are ex-
hibited in the Zagrab Museum do not come from Hungary‚ but from Pola, Trebinye
and Veglia.

8. Budytes feldeggi MIGHAH.

G. ALMASY succeeded in getting two Hungarian specimens from
Temes-Kubin. (Loc. cit. p. 98.) Ι 11766 1101 lucky in obtaining this species,
as I did not find eny on the Littoral last year. The typical specimens of
the Zagrab Museum came from the Dalmatian coast.

9. Budytes paradoxus CHR. L. BR.

R. B. SHARPE gives 1116 Geographical distribution of this bird as
begining from Hungary (Cat. B. Brit. Mus. vol. X. p. 531.). The Hungarian
National Museum has as yet no Hungarian specimens, but ALMASY and
CHERNEL discovered on one occasion 6 series of them 61 Temes-Kubin in

1895. (ALMASY, 100. 011. p. 99.)

10. Budytes taivanus SWINH.

The Hungarian National Museum 1166 6 very typical male and fimale
of this pretty Asiatic bird, collected by Prof. G. SZIKLA in May 1893 61 1116
lake of Velencze. Amnisv states (loc. 011. p. 106), 11161 111657 were mounted
from a skin‚ and thus the feathers of the head are so confused that it is not
possible to make out the colour of 1116 1οΡ of head and superciliars. This
16 1101 1116 0666 and I must contradict Mr. ALMAsY. These specimens killed
by Prof. Sznmi were quite fresh and mounted by himsef in our Museum.

The stuffing of these birds 16 entirely irreproachable and they look
life-like.

This species is new not-only for Hungary but also for the Avifauna
of Europe.
