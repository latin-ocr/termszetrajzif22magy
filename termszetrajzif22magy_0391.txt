FURTHER CONTRIBUTION To THE HUNGARIAN 0111118. :357

11. Sylvia orpheus ΤΕΜΜ.

Τ1118 species 18 very common on the Sea-coast 011 1116 southern part
of the Kal-st. I collected near Fiume and Novi four males and one female
last year. (Loc. cit. p. 474.) In our literature we do not meet 11118 species,
but KORNHUBER («Die Vogel Ungarn’s») mentions it.

12. Monticola cyanea (LINN.).

Very frequent in the Karst mountains, but nowhere 6186. Litffl-ature
mentions 11, but FRIVALDSZKY put it in 1118 Appendix.

13. Saxicola melanoleuca (Gom).

Everywhere common on the Littoral. I collected our specimens at
Novi. (L. cit. p. 473.) memszm does not speak of it. The name of
S. stapazz’na applied by KoRNHUBER (1. cit.) certainly refers to 11118 species.

14. Saxicola aurita TEMM.

Like the former common on the coast. Oui· specimens are from Fiume,
Novi and Povile. FR1VALDSZKY does not mention it.

15. Cinclus albicollis (Vnum).

We have one male in the Museum coming from Hungary, without
an exact mention of the locality. It 18 a present from the Roy. Hung.
Natural-History Soc. in 1856. The Zagrfib Museum possesses two of 1116111
from the vicinity of Zfigrz'tb. New to 1116 Hungarian Ornis.

113. Orites roseus (BLYTH).

Though 11118 8111181166168 18 found throughout the country, Ffflvixmszm'
does not speak of it. We have several typica] home specimens, which per-
fectly resemble English 01168.

17. Aegithalus castaneus Sssv.

A male specimen of this Asiatic species, which was 81101 by Mr. K.
KUNSZT at Csalokoz-Somorja 9-211 May 1896, 18 preserved in 1116 Collection
of the Museum. It 18 also new to the European Fauna.
