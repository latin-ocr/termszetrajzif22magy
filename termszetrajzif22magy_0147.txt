The above characters are those of the type of the genus, lasulvma
dimidiat«. This genus can only be separated from that of Enqlossa by an
examination of the ora] organs. 1 have failed to (11166116 111016 than
02 joints in the labia] palpi and upon this circumstance alone 111116 7 kept
it separated from Enalos-sa. x

The characters given by LEPELETIER are not reliable and the diffe-
rence which he alludes to in the neuration of the wings has no existence:
in both genera the neuration is the same. The labrum varies slightly in
the species, being sometimes square, sometimes slightly narrowed ante-
riorly. The ὅ 111 110111 genera 111116 1116 posterior tibiae thickened, being
convex outwardly. The scutellum is sometimes fiat, sometimes a little con-
161 ; 11 has frequently a t'ossulet at its posterior margin or a depression, the
sides of Which are elevated so as to become bituberculate. The dilated poste-
rior tibiae, fringed at the 611166 and thus forming a backet (similar to that
on the legs of the hive 11661. has led to the supposition of the insects ofthis
genus being social: but direct ‹j›bse1·vation proves the contrary. These bees
are furnished with L) 61111166 at the ape-x of the posterior tibiae, Which none
of the permanently socia] genera possess.

The genus sinmlms which is temporarily 6001111, has spines similar
to the genera Vlseaelema and Eusslossa, and has also the posterior tibiae ex-
panded and fringed at the sides in the same manner as those genera. Thus
116 have a gradation in structure, as well as in habit from Eulvnm to
Eetfslossa and thence 011 to [1011111116 111111 the genera Jlae’l'ismmst Trissomae up
to the genus Apis.»
