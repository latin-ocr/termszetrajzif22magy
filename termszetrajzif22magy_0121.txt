’ GEOCICHLA FRONTALIS. 113

Islands» would do 80. But as neither 0115015 mentions this new form,
I find it necessary to publish a description of it in the present paper.

It seems that 1518 5037 species occupies an intermediate position
between the Geocichla erythronobet, SOLAT. and Geoc‘z'clela (lolef‘rtgsi as

recently described by HARTERT (Novit. Zool. 1896. ΙΠ. p. 555 pl. XL).
Having no material at hand, I am unable to give further comparisons.
